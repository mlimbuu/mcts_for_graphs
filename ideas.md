MCTS Algorithm Implementation
* Node Structure: Each node in the MCTS tree should represent a joint state of all agents.
* Selection: Modify the selection phase to navigate the tree based on the joint state space and joint actions.
* Expansion: In the expansion phase, add all possible joint actions from a node.
* Simulation: During the simulation, simulate the outcomes of joint actions. This might involve randomly selecting actions for each agent but considering the effects of these actions in conjunction.
* Backpropagation: Update nodes with the results of the simulation, considering the combined costs or rewards achieved by the agents.

Coordinated Strategy Evaluation
* Strategy Development: Develop strategies that agents can use to coordinate their actions, especially in response to adversaries.
* Cost Function: Ensure the cost function in the MCTS evaluates joint actions effectively, considering factors like reduced costs due to cooperation.

Complexity Management:
Given the increased complexity, look for ways to optimize the algorithm, such as limiting the depth of the tree or pruning less promising branches.
